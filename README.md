# Awesome Awesome WM [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

> A curated list of high-quality tools/scripts/configs for Awesome Window Manager.

This guide was created because out-of-the-box Awesome WM experience is miserable, yet the WM quickly grows on those courageous enough to tinker with it and weather version-incompatibility issues. This guide was created for those who need a head start with their awesome config.

One problem with Awesome WM is that newer versions of Awesome break a lot of backwards compatibility. Many of the below libraries have been updated to Awesome 4.2, ones that haven't will not work with latest version of Awesome. A library written for Awesome 3.5 will not work with Awesome 4.0 and one written for 3.4 will not work with either so make sure the versions between your modules match. This in itself creates a lot of frustration for users and a segmentation of Awesome user base.

Inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list thing.
